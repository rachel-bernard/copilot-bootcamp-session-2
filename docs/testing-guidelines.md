# Testing Guidelines

## Core Testing Principles

- All new features should include appropriate tests.
- Tests should be maintainable and follow best practices.
- All tests must be isolated and independent. Each test should set up its own data and must not rely on other tests.
- Setup and teardown hooks are required so tests succeed across multiple runs.

## Unit Tests

- Use Jest to test individual functions and React components in isolation.
- Unit tests should use the naming convention *.test.js or *.test.ts.
- Backend unit tests should be placed in packages/backend/__tests__/.
- Frontend unit tests should be placed in packages/frontend/src/__tests__/.
- Name unit test files to match what they are testing (for example: app.test.js for app.js).

## Integration Tests

- Use Jest plus Supertest to test backend API endpoints with real HTTP requests.
- Integration tests should be placed in packages/backend/__tests__/integration/.
- Integration tests should use the naming convention *.test.js or *.test.ts.
- Name integration test files based on what they test (for example: todos-api.test.js for TODO API endpoints).

## End-to-End (E2E) Tests

- Use Playwright (required framework) to test complete UI workflows through browser automation.
- E2E tests should be placed in tests/e2e/.
- E2E tests should use the naming convention *.spec.js or *.spec.ts.
- Name E2E test files based on the user journey they test (for example: todo-workflow.spec.js).
- Playwright tests must use one browser only.
- Playwright tests must use the Page Object Model (POM) pattern for maintainability.
- Limit E2E tests to 5-8 critical user journeys. Focus on happy paths and key edge cases, not exhaustive coverage.

## Port Configuration

- Always use environment variables with sensible defaults for port configuration.
- Backend: const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3030;
- Frontend: React default port is 3000, but it can be overridden with the PORT environment variable.
- This configuration enables CI/CD workflows to dynamically detect ports.
